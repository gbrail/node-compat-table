# Rhino Readme

This fork adds a few scripts that have been adapted so that the 
compatibility table may be run using Rhino.

The repository contains test results that have already been run on recent
Rhino releases.

The "rhinotest.sh" script contains instructions for testing a different Rhino
JAR and adding a new version to the table. If you follow them correctly,
then "index.html" will be updated with a new column.
